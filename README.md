# sn책rkl ("Snorkel")

An Embedded DSL for Verifiable Computing

## Build

sn책rkl builds with GHC version >= 7.8.3. It may compile with earlier versions as well, but this hasn't been tested.

```
> cd src
> make
```
## Examples

[Main.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Main.hs) contains some small sn책rkl programs, used for testing purposes. [app/keccak/Main.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/app/keccak/Main.hs), which can be built by

```
> make keccak
```

from the `src` directory, contains a basic implementation of the Keccak (SHA3) round function, for lane width 1.

## Limitations

sn책rkl is a preliminary research prototype undergoing active development. Although the compiler generates rank-1 constraint systems suitable as input to systems like [scipr-lab/libsnark](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark), the connection to such a system has not yet been implemented.

## Overview of Main Files

* [Source.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Source.hs): A simple embedded source language (statically typed)

* [Expr.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Expr.hs): The first compiler intermediate language (similar to `Source`, except types have been erased) 

* [Constraints.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Constraints.hs): The intermediate arithmetic constraint language

* [R1CS.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/R1CS.hs): Rank-1 constraint systems

* [Simplify.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Simplify.hs): Minimizer/solver for the language in [Constraints]

* [Syntax.hs](https://github.com/gstew5/snarkl/blob/master/src/Syntax.hs): Combinators and (rebound) syntax useful for (meta-)programming in the `Source` language
