Stupid stuff:
-General (in)equality (not just boolean)
  . inequality requires binary decomposition
  . equality can be done more easily (see the Pinnochio paper?)
-Detect field overflow via static analysis on Expr language
  . question: can this be done directly on rationals? or should
    we first do the embedding into F_p?
-Division! via support for general witnesses (computable via 
 arbitrary Hask functions)
